       In this page we collect and answer some frequently asked questions we receive. All of the questions are valid, as
       well as the alternative suggestions. We are also gearing up to forecast other measures.

    2. Is "% of doctor visits that involve flu-like symptoms" the only forecast you are interested in?
    "This seems like the wrong measure - I think many doctors offices will be shut down for “visits” to
     free up resources for treating critical Covid-19 patients."
  </p></font>


  <p>
    Answer: The CDC and other epidemiologists believe that this is the most important measure to forecast.
    While forecasting, however, you can factor in your belief that doctors offices will be shut down for
    routine visits.

    3. “I think the best thing to nowcast would be number of true cases, and to forecast would be number of deaths from
    Covid-19 or perhaps excess mortality, to capture all cause deaths that occur because the hospital system is
    completely overwhelmed."

   <p>
    Answer: This is a very valid question, and the alternatives suggtested are valid as well. Currently we're forecasting
    "% of doctor visits that involve flu-like symptoms", which what CDC asked us to forecast, and this is what one of
    CDC's own surveillance systems is designed to measure.
    We are not able to measure the number of true cases, deaths are not very indicative of the total strain on the
    healthcare system, etc.
